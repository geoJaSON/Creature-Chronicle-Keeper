1) Multi-Scene Meta Puzzles (Gravity Falls Core DNA)

These span multiple exploration scenes. Kids will obsess over these.

Example: Symbol Cipher Language

Every discovery scene shows a weird symbol alphabet.

Journal collects symbols.

Later puzzles require decoding a sentence using the symbols.

Implementation:

Map symbols → letters

Show encoded strings

Let player click symbols to translate

Reward: Secret creatures or artifacts.


2) Simple ciphers
Decode a text using some simple ciphers you must figure out to reveal some lore. Examples
Caesar Cipher (Classic, Works Great)

Mechanic: Shift letters by N.

Scene Example

The journal page says:
“JRGG QXFN”

Player gets a slider or arrows to shift letters.

UI Idea:

Slider from -13 to +13

Live decode preview

Reward: Decoded word reveals artifact or clue.

Why Kids Love It:
They feel like hackers.
Pigpen / Grid Cipher (Visual, No Math)

Classic cipher using grids and dots.

Scene

Show the pigpen key chart on journal page.

Encoded shapes form a word.

Implementation:
Just pre-encode words.
Player clicks shapes → letters.
Substitution Symbol Alphabet (Gravity Falls Core)

Mechanic: Each letter replaced with a symbol.

Scene Example

Show:

🔺 ☀️ 👁️ ☀️ 🔺

Journal page shows mapping for some symbols.

Player Task: Click symbols → letters.

Implementation:

Missing letters guessed by context

Difficulty Control:
